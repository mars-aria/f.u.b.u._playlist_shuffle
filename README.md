# f.u.b.u._playlist_shuffle
This is a computational writing project containing a program called "F.U.B.U. Playlist Shuffle (*For Us By Us) Playlist Shuffle ✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽". My program does a lyrical analysis of the songs "Almeda" and "Don't Touch My Hair" by the artist Solange (a.k.a. Beyonce's sister). Through this lens of cultural and computing exploration, I was able to discover some meaningful things about the importance of rhetorical and poetical word order in black creativity/self expression.
